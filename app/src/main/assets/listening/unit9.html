<p><span style="font-size: large;">Have you ever seen a forest destroyed by fire? A great forest fire is an awful thing to see. Once a fire has started, it spreads quickly. Foresters say that late summer is the season when fire is the greatest danger to woods and foresters. They are very dry then. Sometimes when the danger of fire is very great, foresters will not allow anyone to go into the forests. If people leave a camp-fire burning near a heap of leaves, this often causes a forest fire. Campers must always remember to put out their camp-fire and cover the place with earth. It is the duty of every camper to take the greatest care not to start a forest fire. Anyone careless enough to start a forest fire has done something, which makes life more difficult for all of US. Every fire destroys valuable wood, wild life, and good soil. Everyone of US must know how important it is to care for our great forests and save them from fire.<br /></span></p>
