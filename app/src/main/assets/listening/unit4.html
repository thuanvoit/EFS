<p class="western"><span style="font-size: large;">Well, I wasn&rsquo;t worried when my son bought a computer. After all lots of children have parents who don&rsquo;t understand computers. But when my secretary asked me for a computer in the office, I really became worried. So I decided to take some lessons in computing and my son became my teacher. He was very helpful. He invited me to sit down in front of the computer screen. I did not know what it was called. When asked him what it was, he said that it was a VDU. I still didn&rsquo;t know what a VDU was, but I was too shy to ask him any more. From that moment my memory refused to learn because he told me a lot of things that I really didn&rsquo;t understand at all. After a few lessons I began to feel tired. I made an excuse, saying that I had a headache. I suggested we should leave the lesson for another day. Since then I haven&rsquo;t said anything about the computer to my son and my secretary.</span></p>
