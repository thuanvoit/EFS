<p><span style="font-size: large;">Lan : Hi, Huong. The Titanic is on at the Thang Long Cinema next week. Can you go with me on Wednesday?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Huong : Wednesday? Sorry Lan. I have lots of work to do during the day and I'm going to the singing club at night. Can we go on Thursday, instead?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Lan : I don't think so. I'm going to visit my grandparents on Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Huong : Well, whal about Monday? I suppose you are free on Monday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Lan : No, sorry. I'm going to see a play with Tuyet on Monday. What about Friday?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Huong : Sorry , Lan. Friday is not a good time for me. I&rsquo;m taking Chinese classes on Fridays. How does your weekend look like, Lan?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Lan: Umm... I&rsquo;m busy on Saturday. But i'm free the whole day Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Huong : I&rsquo;m going on a picnic to Hoa Lu with some of my friends on Sunday. I'll be back late at night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Lan : Well. I guess that we just leave. Uh, wait a second, what day are we both free, Huong?<br /></span></p>
