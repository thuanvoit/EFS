<br /> Lan Huong: Hello, I&rsquo;m Lan Huong. Our programme is &ldquo;My Favourite Musician&rdquo;. Now our guest tonight <br /> is Quang Hung, a well-known actor. Welcome to the programme, Quang Hung. Quang Hung: Thanks. Lan Huong. <br /> Lan Huong: Now Quang Hung, can you tell us about the Vietnamese musician you like best, please? Quang Hung: Sure. Recently, there have been quite a few good musicians. Their songs are very popular and easy to listen to. <br /> Lan Huong: Do you like them? <br /> Quang Hung: Well, I do like some of them. But I think the best Vietnamese musician of all times is Van <br /> Cao. He&rsquo;s really my favourite musician. <br /> Lan Huong: Van cao, the author of Tien Quan Ca? Well, can you tell us why you like him? <br /> Quang Hung: He&rsquo;s a great musician. Just listen to Tien Quan Ca. whenever I hear it, I want to stand up and sing out as loud as possible. It&rsquo;s hard and solemn. And I always feel great, feel proud of my country when I hear it. <br /> Lan Huong: That&rsquo;s true. It&rsquo;s very rousing. Do you know when he wrote it? Quang Hung: In 1944. <br /> Lan Huong: Do you like any other songs by Van Cao? <br /> Quang Hung: Oh, yes, lots of them. Especially the songs about rural life in Vietnam. They are sweet and gentle, and very lyrical. <br /> Lan Huong: Well, let me see if we can play one of the songs for you. </p>
