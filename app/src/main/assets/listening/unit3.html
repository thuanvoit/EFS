<p><span style="font-size: large;">If you ask any member of the Vang Trang Khuyet Club which time of day they enjoy most, they will all auree: their photograph lesson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">The Vang Trang Khuyet Club's members come from the Nhan Chinh School for Deaf Children, Xa Dan Secondary School for Deaf and Mute Children, and the Ha Noi Literature and Art Club for Mentally Retarded Children. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">&lsquo;&lsquo;Whenever hold a camera, wandering around and taking in our surroundings through a lens, we can forget the sorrow of our disabilities,&rdquo; says club member Nguyen Minh Tam. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">The six-month-old photographic club, which comprises 19 deaf, mute or mentally retarded children, is now having its first exhibition in Ha Noi. More than 50 colour photos are on display at the exhibition room featuring the beauty of daily life seen through the eyes of these disable children. The subjects are simple and peaceful: old men reading books on the banks of Hoan Kiem Lake, labourers hard at work, at chickens looking for food. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">The children's passion for taking the pictures has stimulated them and helped them escape their sorrow.<br /></span></p>
