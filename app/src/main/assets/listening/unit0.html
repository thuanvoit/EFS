<p class="western" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: large;">Hello everyone, my name is Lam. I&rsquo;m a cyclo driver in HCM City. I usually have a busy working day. I get up at five thirty in the morning. I start work at six. My first passenger is usually an old man. I take him from District 1 to District 5. After I drop him at a cafe near HCM City College of Education, I pedal to Thai Binh Market. My next passenger is a lady who does shopping there every two days. I help her put all her purchases into the cyclo and then take her to her shop in THDao Street. At about ten thirty I ride off toward NTMKhai School. There I park my cyclo, chat with some of my fellows and wait for my third passengers. They are two school pupils, a girl and a boy. I take them home. At twelve I have lunch at a food stall near BT Market. After lunch, I park my cyclo under a tree, take a short rest and then continue my afternoon&rsquo;s work.</span></p>
