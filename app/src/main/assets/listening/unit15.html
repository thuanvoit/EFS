<p><span style="font-size: large;">The ancient town of Hoi An lies on the Thu Bon river, 30 kilometres south of Da Nang. It was formerly a major trading center in Southeast Asia between 16th and 17lh centuries. Hoi An was also an important port for Dutch, Portuguese, Italian, Chinese, Japanese and other merchant vessels from the Far East. Hoi An is famous for its old temples, pagodas, small tile-roofed houses and narrow streets. All the house were made of wood and their pillars were carved with ornamental designs. One of the main attractions of Hoi An is the Japanese Covered Bridge, which was built in the 16th century and is still well-preserved. All visitors to Hoi An are recommended a visit to the Assembly Hall of Cantonese Chinese Congregation. This house was built in 1855 and still keeps many precious objects that belonged to the Chinese community of Hoi An. Another attractive address to tourists is Tan Ky House, which was constructed nearly two centuries ago as a house of a Vietnamese merchant. The house now looks almost exactly as it did in the early 19th century. In recent years, Hoi An has become a popular tourist destination in Viet Nam. In 1999, it was certified by UNESCO as a World Cultural Heritage Site.<br /></span></p>
