<p class="western"><span style="font-size: large;">The weekend picnic 1 enjoyed most was just a few weeks ago. My class decided to pay a visit to the Botanic Garden. It was a glorious Sunday. We assembled at the school gate on time and travelled to the Botanic Garden by bus. It was a long way to our destination and we sang merrily all the way. The Botanic Garden was a very beautiful place. We made a short tour round the garden and took some pictures of the whole class. Then we played a lot of games on a spacious piece of grassland. One of the boys brought along his guitar and we sang our favorite songs. We laughed, talked and danced, too. After a delicious meal with various kinds of food that we brought, we all took a rest. Some of us slept very soundly because it was so peaceful and quiet there. In the afternoon, we went on playing some more games. Then we packed up the left-overs and started home. We all felt happy.<br /></span></p>
